Build test as you deem necessary.

Update docs as we go (with your best judgement) as necessary. Document both tasks and codebase changes.

If you are an agent working in parallel with another, be aware of the work the other agents will/are doing

Feel free to modify AGENTS.md if necessary

Be sensible with typing, file naming, file organization, etc.

When reviewing code, be in depth, detailed, and rigorous with regards to typing, logic, robustness, and running/writing tests. Report back with detailed assessment.

Before making changes, take a look at what changes have been so you have proper context and the tasks.

If new changes shouldn't be pushed to main, let me (the human) know if I should branch, unstage, etc.

Approvals is not needed for web search, feel free to use web search when necessary.

When dividing tasks for agents, ensure tasks are atomic. Parallel agents are being used (two for now), and I won't be using worktrees.

If deemed necessary suggest refactors, and I will verify whether or not to make the changes.
